Hello, I am a four-year actuarial (M1) science student at ISFA.
I have a great passion for computer science (but I remian a beginner in that field ) , which is why I have decided to share several codes that I will be working on independently throughout the year on this page.
For the moment it is pretty empty, but I will be adding more things throughout the year.
